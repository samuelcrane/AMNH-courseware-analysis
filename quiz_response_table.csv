1,1,954,Climate change is predicted to reduce or eliminate the potato as a food source in most of the world because colder conditions are necessary to grow potatoes.
1,2,127,"Potatoes were first cultivated in the seasonally cold regions of the Andes about 10,000 years ago."
1,3,125,Modifying the potato began through culturing wild potatoes to produce native potatoes with farmers selecting varieties that met their local needs.
1,4,119,"Potato diversity is now under threat from climate change, political instability, and urbanization."
2,1,65,the use of plant tissue culture procedures to replicate and proliferate desirable varieties of plants
2,2,62,the creation of new varieties of plants for food through traditional breeding experiments
2,3,1146,the insertion of genes from one organism to another through direct modification of the genome
2,4,59,the development of new drug therapies through genetic engineering
3,1,119,a variety of native maize grown in South America
3,2,51,not an important food crop for the developing world
3,3,120,unknown in its native form
3,4,1038,under threat in its native form in the Cerrado Savannah region of Brazil as the habitat is planted in soybean
4,1,78,the movement of a GMO into the natural environment that would cause elimination of the natural organism (such as the escape of genetically modified salmon into the natural environment)
4,2,89,the ability to maintain a safe food supply as genes are introduced into the food supply (as in introducing Brazil nut protein into soybean and the related concern for allergic response to the blended food)
4,3,1099,that growers of GMOs receive government crop subsidies for only growing non-modified plants
4,4,67,that the hybridization of GMOs may adversely affect the biology of a native species (as in the production of an invasive species)
5,1,1105,"Only specific, targeted genes are introduced into genetically engineered plants."
5,2,62,"Genetically engineered plants can only accept genes from very closely related plant species, usually within the same plant genus."
5,3,50,Genetic engineering is a slow process and can take many more years than traditional plant breeding.
5,4,117,"Genetic engineering can produce very different looking plants, like cauliflower, whereas traditional plant breeding results in crops that look like wild relatives. "
6,1,113,genetically altered cotton - the introduction of a spider silk gene into the genome of cotton plants that produces stronger cotton fiber
6,2,1002,genetically altered bacteria - the introduction of the human insulin gene into bacteria for use in the commercial production of insulin
6,3,104,genetically altered corn - the introduction of a jellyfish gene to make the corn glow green when placed under a black light
6,4,110,genetically altered salmon - salmon engineered to include a gene that limits the production of oil by the fish and results in a better flavored product
7,1,1150,genes
7,2,66,proteins
7,3,68,viruses
7,4,48,chromosomes
8,1,1188,bacteria
8,2,42,fungus
8,3,56,insect
8,4,41,other plant
9,1,84,"Genetic testing can reveal information about relatives, not just the person giving consent for the testing. "
9,2,79,Genomic information may lead to stereotyping or discrimination based on group membership. 
9,3,125,Genomic information may tell a person more about themselves then they really want to know. 
9,4,1042,Genomic information about a person's ancestry and health may be misleading since the technology is so new and the data might be wrong. 
10,1,1017,Fewer corn plants are sowed per acre since genetically modified corn must be planted with additional space between plants in order to have the gene produce the Bt insecticidal protein effectively.
10,2,80,Researchers have raised concerns that crossbreeding of genetically modified corn to crops in nearby fields may occur.
10,3,122,Farmers are concerned that patenting genetically modified corn may result in price controls by the companies owning the patents.
10,4,110,Corn modified with the Bt insecticidal protein gene is not specific to the European corn borer larvae and may result in the deaths of non-targeted insects.
