coursera-class-analysis
=======================

I worked as data manager for a sequence of classes taught by the American Museum of Natural History on the Coursera platform in 2013. The data analysis tools provided by Coursera were rather crude, so I had to make my own. These scripts were used to gather, process, and report on the students' usage of the courseware and progess with the lessons. 

This is old stuff now and likely needs updating to use anything from Coursera now and in the future. 

Scripts for data manipulation and visualization of raw course data from the Coursera platform.
